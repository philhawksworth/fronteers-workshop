# My Meetups Site

An example site for a workshop.
The site is for a fictional series of meetups.


## Local development

To build the site you need:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) - to run the build
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - to install an manage dependencies


### Getting started

```bash

# clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:philhawksworth/fronteers-workshop.git

# go to the working directory
# there are several directories to help us through the exercises
cd fronteers-workshop/1

# install dependencies
yarn

# start a local build server with hot reloading
yarn start
```


## Deployment

The build command `yarn run build` will generate a set of static assets in a `dist` folder which can be deployed to any web hosting service.

[Netlify](http://www.netlify.com) runs this build process in a CI environment and then deploys the build automatically to our global CDN. Such deployments are [triggered automatically](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) by every git push to the `master` branch of the origin repository.
